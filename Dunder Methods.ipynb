    "__Polymorphism__\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to define a generic type of behavior that will potentially behave differently when applied to different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is polymorphic in nature:\n",
    "- duck typing: if it walks and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck\n",
    "    - e.g. when iterating over a collection, that object just needs to support the iterable protocol, the type of the object doesnt matter.\n",
    "    \n",
    "__Special Methods__\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add support in our classes for Pythons built-in functionality using special, or 'dunder', methods. These are charcterized by having double underscores before and after the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Creation/Instantiation:\n",
    "- `__init__`\n",
    "- `__new__`\n",
    "\n",
    "Context Managers:\n",
    "- `__enter__`\n",
    "- `__exit__`\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence Types:\n",
    "- `__getitem__`\n",
    "- `__setitem__`\n",
    "- `__delitem__`\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterables/Iterators:\n",
    "- `__iter__`\n",
    "- `__next__`\n",
    "\n",
    "Others:\n",
    "- `__len__`\n",
    "- `__contains__`\n",
    "\n",
    "**`__str__` vs `__repr__`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both used to create string representations of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, `repr` is used in development to display information on how that object was created (eg. arguments to init). Used when calling the `repr()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`str` is used by `str()` and `print()` as well as formatting functions, typically used for display purposes for end user, logging, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `str` is not implemented, Python will use `repr` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Arithmetic Operators__\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__add__`: +\n",
    "- `__sub__`: -\n",
    "- `__mul__`: *\n",
    "- `__truediv__`: /\n",
    "- `__floordiv__`: //\n",
    "- `__mod__`: %\n",
    "- `__pow__`: **\n",
    "- `__matmul__`: @ (used for numpy support in matrix multiplication)\n",
    "\n",
    "All these examples above also have the reflected version, which will perform the operation from the right operand to the left operand (e.g. `__radd__`)\n",
    "\n",
    "They also have the in-place versions, which modify the lhs object ( e.g. `__iadd__`: += )\n",
    "\n",
    "Further operators:\n",
    "- `__neg__`: `-a`\n",
    "- `__pos__`: `+a`\n",
    "- `__abs__`: `abs(a)`\n",
    "\n",
    "__Rich Comparisons__\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__lt__`: <\n",
    "- `__le__`: <=\n",
    "- `__eq__`: ==\n",
    "- `__ne__`: !=\n",
    "- `__gt__`: >\n",
    "- `__ge__`: >=\n",
    "\n",
    "__Hashing and Equality__\n",
    "\n",
    "An object must be hashable if you want to use it in a mapping type (dictionary key, set element). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if implementing `__hash__`, `__eq__` should also be implemented. Only do so for immutable objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, when an override is not specified:\n",
    "- `__hash__` uses the id of the object\n",
    "- `__eq__` uses the identity comparison (is)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Booleans__\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object has an associated boolean value, any non-zero number is true and any empty collection is false, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, any custom object also has a truth value which can be overriden by defining `__bool__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `__bool__` is not defined, Python uses `__len__` and if len is not defined, the result will always be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Callable__\n",
    "\n",
    "Any object can be made to emulate a callable by implementing the `__call__` method. Useful for creating function-like objects that need to maintain state, or for creating decorator classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Finalizer__\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing the `__del__` method, we can add functionality that will be called when either the Python GC destroys the object or if we use the `del` keyword with the object."
